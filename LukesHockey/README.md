Luke's Hockey is an html program that I wrote in high school as a side project. The game involves two human controlled players
and two computer controlled goalies. The goal is to score more goals than your opponent during the game.

To play, download the html file and open it using chrome or another web browser

Mechanics:

Before the game starts, each team can choose their name and color
Each team can decide how large their player will be
This determines how fast and how much mass the player will have

A player gains control of the puck if they touch it
Once a player gains control of the puck, they have the option to shoot it
The puck is shot in the direction that the player is moving
To steal the puck from the other player, you must bump into them to knock the puck free

The goalies are computer controlled
They will attempt to push themselves into a better position to make a save
Goalies can be tricked into overcommiting by spamming the up or down movement key with possession of the puck (This allows for easy goals)

Tournaments are not implemented yet :(
